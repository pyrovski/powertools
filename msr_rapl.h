 * power unit is in 1/8 Watts increment.
 *
 * Energy Status Units (bits 12:8):  Energy related
 * information (in Joules) is based on the multiplier
 * 1/2^{ESU}; where ESU is an unsigned integer 
 * represented by bits 12:8.  Default value is 
 * 10000b, indicating energy status unit is in 
 * 15.3 microJoules increment.  
 * [1/2^{16} = 1.525879e-05].
 *
 * Time Units (bits 19:16):  Time realted information
 * (in seconds) is based on the multiplier, 1/2^{TU};
 * where TU is an unsigned integer represented by bits
 * 19:16.  Default value is 1010b, indicating time 
 * unit is 976 micro-seconds increment.
